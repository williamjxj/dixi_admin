You can use Redis as a session handler, which is especially useful if you are using a multi-server architecture behind a load balancer. 
Redis also has a publish/subscribe system, which is great for creating an online chat or a live booking system. 

There is a lot of argument whether Redis or Memcache is better, though as the benchmarks show they perform pretty much 
on par with each other for basic operations. 
Redis has more features than Memcache, such as in-memory and disk persistence, atomic commands and transactions, 
and not logging every change to disk but rather server-side data structures instead.
